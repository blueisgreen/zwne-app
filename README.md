## WIP

Starting over by porting the latest code into a new project. We will get things back in shape before long.

## Starting Punchlist

- Basic features
  - User authentication: Get sign up, sign in, sign out working.
  - Account management: Profile updates, usage history.
  - Basic lesson authoring: allow authorized users to create and publish lessons about nuclear power.
  - Course management: connect lessons together in meaningful ways.
  - Lesson engagement: Take lessons, and leave comments.
- Other
  - Unit tests
  - System tests
  - Try i18n (Spanish, Japanese?)
  - Build for mobile (cordova)
  - Build for desktop (electron)
  - Hosting on AWS
